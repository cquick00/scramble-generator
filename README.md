## Purpose

The general purpose of this app is to give people an easy way to generate scrambles for all of their favorite twisty puzzles (e.g. 2x2, ..., 11x11, Pyraminx, Megaminx, etc.).

## Coming Soon :construction:

- Add the ability to get more scramble instructions for non-3x3 puzzles (e.g. 2x2, ..., 11x11, Pyraminx, Megaminx, etc.)
- Fix typing issues that don't currently break the app but do cause errors to show up in source code
- Create an AppImage package for Linux use

## Completed :white_check_mark:

- Base GUI made with PySimpleGUI
- Scrambles for 3x3 cubes are able to be made for a dynamic number of moves
- Logo created
- Package created using Auto Py To Exe
- Dropdown to select puzzle
- Ability to leave the desired number of moves blank for defaults
- Created installer using Inno Setup
