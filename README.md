### Attributions

## Purpose

The general purpose of this app is to give people an easy way to generate scrambles for all of their favorite twisty puzzles (e.g. Rubik's Cubes (2x2, 3x3, 4x4, etc.)).

## Coming Soon :construction:

- Add the ability to get more scramble instructions for non-cube puzzle (e.g. Pyraminx, Megaminx, etc.)
- Add dropdown menu to select which puzzle type you'd like instructions for (e.g. Cube, Pyraminx, Megaminx, etc.)
- Package and make available on other platforms (e.g. Android, iOS, Linux)
  - Currently only usable on Windows
- Fix typing issues that don't currently break the app but do cause errors to show up in source code


## Completed :white_check_mark:

- Base GUI made with PySimpleGUI
- Scramble for regular cubes (e.g. Rubik's Cubes (2x2, 3x3, 4x4, etc.) are able to be made for a dynamic number of moves
- Logo created
- Package created using Auto Py To Exe
