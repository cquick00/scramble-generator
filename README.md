## Purpose

The general purpose of this app is to give people an easy way to generate scrambles for all of their favorite twisty puzzles (e.g. 2x2, ..., 11x11, Pyraminx, Megaminx, etc.).

## Coming Soon :construction:

- Add the ability to get more scramble instructions for non-3x3 puzzles (e.g. 2x2, ..., 11x11, Pyraminx, Megaminx, etc.)
- Add dropdown menu to select which puzzle type you'd like instructions for (e.g. 2x2, ..., 11x11, Pyraminx, Megaminx, etc.)
- Package and make available on other platforms (e.g. Android, iOS, Linux)
  - Currently only usable on Windows
- Fix typing issues that don't currently break the app but do cause errors to show up in source code
- Add installer to the release so that it's easier for people to make use of like a normal application
  - I basically just want to move it to the C:\Program Files folder and add a shortcut to the app to the Start Menu folder


## Completed :white_check_mark:

- Base GUI made with PySimpleGUI
- Scrambles for 3x3 cubes are able to be made for a dynamic number of moves
- Logo created
- Package created using Auto Py To Exe
