## Reporting a Vulnerability

Use this section to tell people how to report a vulnerability.

Tell them where to go, how often they can expect to get an update on a
reported vulnerability, what to expect if the vulnerability is accepted or
declined, etc.

You can report a known vulnerability by going to the [issues](https://github.com/cquick00/scramble-generator/issues) page and opening an issue detailing the vulnerability as follows:

```
Vulernability Name:
Vulnerability Informational Link:
```

I will do my best to get to update the Scramble Generator package as soon as possible and provide a new release to correct any known vulnerabilities.
